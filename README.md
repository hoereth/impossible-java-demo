# Impossible Java Demo

This is a collection of Java examples which seem "impossible". It's about common pitfalls and edge cases. 

## Structure

For every **Demo.java** file there is a **DemoSolution.java** file. The **Demo.java** presents a problem or question. The **DemoSolution.java** provides you with an explanation. All Java classes contain jUnit test methods for live demonstration of the issue.
